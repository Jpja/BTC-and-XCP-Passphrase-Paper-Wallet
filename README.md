Forked from Blockscan.com.

I've modified the address generation tool to output a printer friendly paper wallet.

It prints the list of Bitcoin/Counterparty addresses and (optionally) private keys derived from a passphrase. The passphrase is compatible with Counterwallet, XCP Wallet for Chrome, and GetGems Messenger.

Update 22 April 2015

* I consider the project finished. It's tested and works well in FF, Chrome, Opera and IE.
* The code is forked from Blockscan's key generation tool. All changes are cosmetic.
* The html file can run offline. All code is included in this file, so you do not need to unzip the directory to run it.
* I cannot guarantee that the code is bug free. I encourage other to review the code and potentially improve/fork it.
