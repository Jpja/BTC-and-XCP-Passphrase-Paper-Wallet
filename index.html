<h2>BTC and XCP Passphrase Tools</h1><br />

<a href="paperwallet.html"><strong>Paperwallet</strong></a><br /><br />

Outputs a printer friendly paper wallet.<br /><br />

It prints the list of Bitcoin/Counterparty addresses and (optionally) private keys derived from a passphrase. The passphrase is compatible with Counterwallet, XCP Wallet for Chrome, and GetGems Messenger.<br /><br />

Update 22 April 2015<br /><br />

&nbsp;* I consider the project finished. It's tested and works well in FF, Chrome, Opera and IE.<br />
&nbsp;* The code is forked from Blockscan's key generation tool. All changes are cosmetic.<br />
&nbsp;* The html file can run offline. All code is included in this file, so you do not need to unzip the directory to run it.<br />
&nbsp;* I cannot guarantee that the code is bug free. I encourage other to review the code and potentially improve/fork it.<br /><br /><br />

<a href="vanity-address.html"><strong>Vanity-address</strong></a><br /><br />

Finds a passphrase which yields vanity addresses. Specify vanity patterns for up to three addresses. The pattern starts with 1 followed by one or more characters. When specifying patterns, consider this:<br /><br />

&nbsp;* The algorithm tries random passphrases until it finds the desired patterns. This can take a long time. Your browser may freeze.<br />
&nbsp;* By default it stops searching after 1000 iterations but you can ovverrule this by writing inf at the begiining of the random text input string.<br />
&nbsp;* Around 10 passphrases are tested per second. The probability of an address starting with 1A is 1/22. Therefore it takes a couple seconds to find one address which starts with 1A. If you want both the first two addresses to start with 1A, the probability is squared, 1/484. Therefore be prepared to wait around a minute. If all three addresses shall start with 1A, the proability is cubed and you'll likely have to wait around twenty minutes.<br />
&nbsp;* Addresses starting with 12,...,19,1A,...1P are more the most likely to find.<br />
&nbsp;* For subsequent characters the probability is approx. 1/58. Therefore by adding one character to one address you can expext to wait 58 times longer!<br />
&nbsp;* Example: To make one address start with 1CP, expect to wait 2-3 minutes; p = 1/(22*58).<br />
&nbsp;* Example: To make one address start with 1XP, expect to wait a couple of hours. This is slow because 1X is rare; p=1/(1353*58).<br />
&nbsp;* Example: To make both the first two addresses start with 1A, expect to wait less than a minute; p=1/22^2.<br />
&nbsp;* Example: To make all the first three address start with 1A, expect to wait around twenty minutes; p=1/22^3.<br /><br /><br />

<a href="brain-passphrase.html"><strong>Brain-passphrase</strong></a><br /><br />

Generates a 12-word passphrase from a text input. The passphrase can be used in Counterwallet, XCP Chrome Wallet and GetGems Messenger.<br /><br />

Pending security audit.<br /><br />

Use at own risk! Note: This can be used as a sort of brain wallet. I advice against using it as such, but feel free to play around.<br /><br /><br />
